## 📌 Project Overview

This project runs real-time object detection on video input to identify common fish species found in the New England region, using a YOLOv8 ONNX model on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Orin platform with Jetson Inference.

Built using **TensorRT**, **YOLOv8**, and **Jetson-inference**, it enables fast and accurate detection with GPU acceleration.

## ❓ Why

Fishermen often struggle to identify fish in the field. This tool:

- Helps classify and label fish instantly on-device
- Saves time and effort spent manually searching online
- Helps avoid regulatory errors (e.g., mislabeling protected species)
- Is portable for field or dock use, powered by Jetson Nano
