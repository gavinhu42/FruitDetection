**Project Overview**

This project uses a dataset of common fruits to train a YOLOv8 classification model. Running on the Jetson Nano Orin, it accurately identifies different types of fruits such as apples, bananas, and oranges. This system helps automate fruit classification tasks for agriculture, retail, or quality control.

**Why**

Classifying fruits correctly is essential for farmers, vendors, and retailers to streamline sorting, inventory, and sales. This program removes the guesswork by providing fast, accurate fruit identification directly on the Jetson Nano edge device, without needing internet connectivity or manual lookup.
